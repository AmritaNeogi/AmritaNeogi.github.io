### Active learning for efficient navigation of multi-component gas adsorption landscapes in MOFs (Under Peer Review)
* Designed a Active learning workflow to predict gas mixture adsorption in MOFs (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>).
* Developed an accuracy-based protocol as a stoppage criteria for the Active learning on gas mixture
adsorption in MOFs for a pressure-mole fraction and also for pressure-mole fraction-temperature phase
space (CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>, Xe-Kr, and H<sub>2</sub>S-CO<sub>2</sub>). For more details, visit the github page of the project.
