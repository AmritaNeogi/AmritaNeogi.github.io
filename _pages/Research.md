## Active learning for efficient navigation of multi-component gas adsorption landscapes in MOFs (Under Peer Review)
* Designed a Active learning workflow to predict gas mixture adsorption in MOFs (CO2-CH4, H2S-CO2,
and Xe-Kr).
* Developed an accuracy-based protocol as a stoppage criteria for the Active learning on gas mixture
adsorption in MOFs for a pressure-mole fraction and also for pressure-mole fraction-temperature phase
space (CO2-CH4, H2S-CO2, and Xe-Kr). For more details, visit the github page of the project.
