**I am a Chemical Engineer with interest in computational materials discovery and process optimization using molecular modeling, statistics, and data science. 
My current research at University of Notre Dame is focused on applying molecular simulations (monte carlo and molecular dynamics), machine learning, and statistics to understand adsorption, selectivity, and other properties in nanoporous structures.**


## Active learning for efficient navigation of multi-component gas adsorption landscapes in MOFs
* Designed a Active learning workflow to predict gas mixture adsorption in MOFs (CO2-CH4, H2S-CO2,
and Xe-Kr).
* Developed an accuracy-based protocol as a stoppage criteria for the Active learning on gas mixture
adsorption in MOFs for a pressure-mole fraction and also for pressure-mole fraction-temperature phase
space (CO2-CH4, H2S-CO2, and Xe-Kr).
