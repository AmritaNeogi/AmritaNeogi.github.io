<br>I'm delighted to have you here and share a glimpse into my journey.
</p>
  <br>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
I am currently in the final year of my <strong>Master of Science in Data Science </strong> program at the esteemed University of Arizona, Tucson. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently maintained a perfect <strong>CGPA of 4.0 on a 4.0 scale</strong>, showcasing my dedication to excellence and passion for learning in the field of data science.

<br>
<br>

Prior to my academic pursuits, I gained invaluable real-world experience as an Informatica ETL developer at Tata Consultancy Services in India. Over a span of <strong>4.5 years</strong>, I delved into the intricate realm of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. My time there not only refined my technical skills but also ignited my passion for leveraging data to solve complex business challenges. This hands-on experience not only equipped me with technical expertise but also fostered a deep appreciation for the practical applications of data science.

<br>

While my journey might seem unique, my educational foundation in Electrical Engineering plays a significant role in shaping my perspective. I pursued my <strong>Bachelors in Electrical Engineering</strong>, yet my passion for computer science and technology was unswerving, eventually steering me towards the exciting world of data science.

<br> 
<br>

As I approach the culmination of my academic journey, I am excited to blend my academic achievements, practical experience, and unwavering enthusiasm for data science. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of information technology, extracting knowledge from data, driving informed decision-making, and crafting innovative solutions that leave a positive impact on industries and society.
