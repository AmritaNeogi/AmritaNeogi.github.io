      My ongoing project represents a pioneering effort to advance phenological research by merging state-of-the-art technology with deep learning techniques. With a focus on predictive modeling and validation on a significant scale, my work aims to uncover the intricate connection between PhenoCam images and vegetation phenology development. <br>
      At its core, this project is centered around creating a predictive tool using CNN Regression to forecast leaf phenology in deciduous broadleaf forests across various sites. Three key methods: AlexNet, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101 will be employed. Each of these approaches contributes uniquely to our understanding of phenology patterns. By harnessing the power of deep learning, I aim to extract subtle details from PhenoCam images, offering insights that might remain unnoticed by human observation. This work holds immense promise for ecological understanding, climate insights, and agricultural planning. <br>
